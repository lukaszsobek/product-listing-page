### Product Listing Page with:
JavaScript, ES6, React, JSX, Redux, Jest, RWD

### Clone the repo, and then:
- yarn start - starts dev server with auto update and lint
- yarn test - starts tests with auto update
- yarn build - creates production build

### Test coverage:
- Components (smart & dumb), actions, components, store, middleware

### Note:
- Scss in this app would have been overkill. There are, however css variables for colors and a little bit of BEM mixed in.

## Potential To Do:
- Add missing reducer tests
- Add missing clear filter option to remove filters
- Refactor dropdowns to independent component
- Extract reducers into separate files
- Make dropdown style more appealing
- Fetching Products from an external api
