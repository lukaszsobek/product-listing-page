## Clone the repo, and then:
- yarn start - starts dev server with auto update and lint
- yarn test - starts tests with auto update
- yarn build - creates production build

## Can do:
- Can see items.
- Can resize screen and items will reflow to fit.
- Can use dropdown to toggle category filter, if filter is set the app will only show items from the selected category.
- Can use multiple categories to show items from.
- Can use dropdown to toggle color filter, if filter is set only items with a given color will be listed.
- Can use multiple colors as basis for filtering.
- Can use a combination of colors and categories to filter items.
- Can run tests on parts of the application listed below.

## Test coverage:
- Components (smart & dumb), actions, components, store, middleware

## Note:
- Scss in this app would have been overkill. There are, however css variables for colors and a little bit of BEM mixed in.

## To Do:
- Add missing reducer tests
- Add clear filter option to remove filters
- Refactor dropdowns to independent component
- Fetching Products from an external api
- Add showing active filters
